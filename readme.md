##Next Generation Exception Handling

The Seam Catch module creates a simple, yet robust base for other modules and 
users to create a custom and complete exception handling process. Exception 
handling is done using CDI events, keeping exception handling noninvasive and 
also helping the program or module to stay minimally coupled to the exception 
handling framework.

Seam Catch is independent of CDI implementation and fully portable between 
Java EE 6 environments
